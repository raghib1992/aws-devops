# Code Deploy
## Automate software deployment to verify  of compute service such as ec2, fargate, lambda
************************************************************************
# Install the CodeDeploy agent for Amazon Linux or RHEL

# Deploy Code deploy

## Steps for code deploy with s3 have artifacts and install it in ec2
1. Create IAM role for Code Deloy with s3 read only access
- service type: code deploy
- role name; codedeploy-role
- policy: AWSCodeDeployROle + s3ReadOnly

2. Create IAM role for ec2 with s3 readOnlyAccess
- service type: ec2
- role name: ec2-s3ReadOnly-role
- policy: s3ReadOnly

3. Launch Ec2 inst with appropriate role
- attach the role created in step2

4. Install code deploy agent
#### Ref "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/codedeploy-agent-operations-install-linux.html"
- install agent
```sh
sudo yum update -y 
sudo yum install ruby wget -y 
cd /home/ec2-user
# Chane bucket name and region
wget https://bucket-name.s3.region-identifier.amazonaws.com/latest/install
```
#### To get bucket name as per your region
### Ref https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/resource-kit.html#resource-kit-bucket-names
```sh
wget https://aws-codedeploy-eu-north-1.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/latest/install
chmod +x ./install
sudo ./install auto
sudo service codedeploy-agent start
sudo service codedeploy-agent status
```

5. Configure code deploy service
- Create Application
    - Name: demoappluication
    - Compute Platform: Ec2/Onpremises
- Create deployment Group
    - Name: demo-deployment-group
    - service-role: select the IAM role created in step 1
    - Environment variable: Amazon Ec2 instances -> Select Tag of ec2 instanc 
- create Deployment
- Start Deployemnt: click om **create Deployment**
- deployment Setting
#### Generally code deploy looks for appspec.yaml, for what operation needs to perform
##### appspec.yaml
```yml
version: 0.0
os: linux
files:
   - source: /
     destination: /tmp
hooks:
   BeforeInstall:
    - location: scripts/runbuild.sh # This script run to cp file from s3 to local
      runas: root
```
##### runbuild.sh
```sh
#!/bin/bash
aws s3 cp s3://code-build-demo-project/demo-build-project/my-app /tmp/
```
- Zip the appspec and depends script and upload it on s3
- Select revision type: where is my application stored in amazon s3 or github
- create deployemnt

# Deployment Configuration
### EC2 and On premises
- Developer Tools -> Deploy -> Deplyment configuration
1. CodeDeployDefault.AllAtOnce
- deploy to as amny instances possible at once
- status is displayed succeeded if app revision is deployed to one or more of the instances.
2. CodeDeployDefault.HalfAtOnce
- deploy to half of the instances at a time
- status succeeded if deployed to at least half of the instances
3. CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime
- deploy one at a time
- succeed if deployment to all of the instances, except last instances
4. Can create custom configuration

### lambda and ECS
1. Canary: deploy in 2 increament
2. Linear: equal number of increment at equal time
3. All-at-once
****************************************
# deloyemnt Lifecycle
### deployemt lifecycle, there are many steps you might take while installing and configuring the updated app:
1. Block the traffic to the server
2. Stop and remove the oler application
3. pull the latest application from repo
4. install the app
5. start the service
6. validation

## Appspec Hooks
1. **Start**
2. Application stop
3. Download Bundle
4. Before install
5. **istall**
6. after install
7. Application start
8. Validate service
9. **End**

## Appspec hook with ELB
1. Before Block Traffic: Run task before de-register from LB
2. Block Traffic: Internet traffic block
3. AfterBlock Traffic: Run task after de-register from LB
4. Application stop
5. Download Bundle
6. Before install
7. istall
8. after install
9. Application start
10. Validate service
11. Before Allow Traffic
12. Allow Traffic
13. After Allow Traffic
*************************************
# deployment Type
1. In-Place
- on each instance in the deployment group is stopped, the latest application revision is installed, and the new revision of the application is started and validetion
2. Blue-Green
- Complete nwe set of deloyment and tranfer the Lb to new set of deployment
- deployment setting
   - traffic rerouting: immediately/choose
- Choose wheather instance is terminated
