Module 4: Deploy a RESTful API
In this module, you will use Amazon API Gateway to expose the Lambda function you built in the previous module as a RESTful API. This API will be accessible on the public Internet. It will be secured using the Amazon Cognito user pool you created in the previous module. Using this configuration, you will then turn your statically hosted website into a dynamic web application by adding client-side JavaScript that makes AJAX calls to the exposed APIs.
