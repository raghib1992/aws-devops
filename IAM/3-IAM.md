# IAM
1. User
- By default user doesn't have any permission
2. Rules
3. Resource

## IAM POlicy
1. AWS managed policy
- An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS
- Standalone policy means that the policy has its own Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that includes the policy name. For example, arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/IAMReadOnlyAccess is an AWS managed policy
2. a customer managed policy
- You create these customer managed policies for your specific use cases, and you can change and update them as often as you like
3. or an inline policy
- An inline policy is a policy created for a single IAM identity (a user, group, or role). Inline policies maintain a strict one-to-one relationship between a policy and an identity. They are deleted when you delete the identity. You can create a policy and embed it in an identity, either when you create the identity or later. If a policy could apply to more than one entity, itâ€™s better to use a managed policy.

# Element in IAM Policy
1. version
2. Statement
3. Effect
4. Action
5. Resources
6. Principal
- Specify things like IAM user, federated user, IAM ROle, aws account, aws services and etc
- You cannot use principal element in an IAM identity based policy
```json
"Principal": {"AWS":"arn:aws:iam::account-id:root"}
```
